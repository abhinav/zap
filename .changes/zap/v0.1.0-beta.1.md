## 0.1.0-beta.1 (6 Feb 2017)

This is a minor version, tagged to allow users to pin to the pre-1.0 APIs and
upgrade at their leisure. Since this is the first tagged release, there are no
backward compatibility concerns and all functionality is new.

Early zap adopters should pin to the 0.1.x minor version until they're ready to
upgrade to the upcoming stable release.
