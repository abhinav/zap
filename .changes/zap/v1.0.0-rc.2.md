## 1.0.0-rc.2 (21 Feb 2017)

This is the second release candidate for zap's stable release. It includes two
breaking changes.

Breaking changes:

* [#316][]: Zap's global loggers are now fully concurrency-safe
  (previously, users had to ensure that `ReplaceGlobals` was called before the
  loggers were in use). However, they must now be accessed via the `L()` and
  `S()` functions. Users can update their projects with

  ```
  gofmt -r "zap.L -> zap.L()" -w .
  gofmt -r "zap.S -> zap.S()" -w .
  ```
* [#309][] and [#317][]: RC1 was mistakenly shipped with invalid
  JSON and YAML struct tags on all config structs. This release fixes the tags
  and adds static analysis to prevent similar bugs in the future.

Bugfixes:

* [#321][]: Redirecting the standard library's `log` output now
  correctly reports the logger's caller.

Enhancements:

* [#325][] and [#333][]: Zap now transparently supports non-standard, rich
  errors like those produced by `github.com/pkg/errors`.
* [#326][]: Though `New(nil)` continues to return a no-op logger, `NewNop()` is
  now preferred. Users can update their projects with `gofmt -r 'zap.New(nil) ->
  zap.NewNop()' -w .`.
* [#300][]: Incorrectly importing zap as `github.com/uber-go/zap` now returns a
  more informative error.
