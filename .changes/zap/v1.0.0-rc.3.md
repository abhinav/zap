## 1.0.0-rc.3 (7 Mar 2017)

This is the third release candidate for zap's stable release. There are no
breaking changes.

Bugfixes:

* [#339][]: Byte slices passed to `zap.Any` are now correctly treated as binary blobs
  rather than `[]uint8`.

Enhancements:

* [#307][]: Users can opt into colored output for log levels.
* [#353][]: In addition to hijacking the output of the standard library's
  package-global logging functions, users can now construct a zap-backed
  `log.Logger` instance.
* [#311][]: Frames from common runtime functions and some of zap's internal
  machinery are now omitted from stacktraces.

Thanks to @ansel1 and @suyash for their contributions to this release.
