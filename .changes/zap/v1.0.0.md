## 1.0.0 (14 Mar 2017)

This is zap's first stable release. All exported APIs are now final, and no
further breaking changes will be made in the 1.x release series. Anyone using a
semver-aware dependency manager should now pin to `^1`.

Breaking changes:

* [#366][]: Add byte-oriented APIs to encoders to log UTF-8 encoded text without
  casting from `[]byte` to `string`.
* [#364][]: To support buffering outputs, add `Sync` methods to `zapcore.Core`,
  `zap.Logger`, and `zap.SugaredLogger`.
* [#371][]: Rename the `testutils` package to `zaptest`, which is less likely to
  clash with other testing helpers.

Bugfixes:

* [#362][]: Make the ISO8601 time formatters fixed-width, which is friendlier
  for tab-separated console output.
* [#369][]: Remove the automatic locks in `zapcore.NewCore`, which allows zap to
  work with concurrency-safe `WriteSyncer` implementations.
* [#347][]: Stop reporting errors when trying to `fsync` standard out on Linux
  systems.
* [#373][]: Report the correct caller from zap's standard library
  interoperability wrappers.

Enhancements:

* [#348][]: Add a registry allowing third-party encodings to work with zap's
  built-in `Config`.
* [#327][]: Make the representation of logger callers configurable (like times,
  levels, and durations).
* [#376][]: Allow third-party encoders to use their own buffer pools, which
  removes the last performance advantage that zap's encoders have over plugins.
* [#346][]: Add `CombineWriteSyncers`, a convenience function to tee multiple
  `WriteSyncer`s and lock the result.
* [#365][]: Make zap's stacktraces compatible with mid-stack inlining (coming in
  Go 1.9).
* [#372][]: Export zap's observing logger as `zaptest/observer`. This makes it
  easier for particularly punctilious users to unit test their application's
  logging.
