## 1.15.0 (23 Apr 2020)

Bugfixes:
* [#804][]: Fix handling of `Time` values out of `UnixNano` range.
* [#812][]: Fix `IncreaseLevel` being reset after a call to `With`.

Enhancements:
* [#806][]: Add `WithCaller` option to supersede the `AddCaller` option. This
  allows disabling annotation of log entries with caller information if
  previously enabled with `AddCaller`.
* [#813][]: Deprecate `NewSampler` constructor in favor of
  `NewSamplerWithOptions` which supports a `SamplerHook` option. This option
   adds support for monitoring sampling decisions through a hook.
