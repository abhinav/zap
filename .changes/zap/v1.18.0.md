## 1.18.0 (28 Jun 2021)

Enhancements:
* [#961][]: Add `zapcore.BufferedWriteSyncer`, a new `WriteSyncer` that buffers
  messages in-memory and flushes them periodically.
* [#971][]: Add `zapio.Writer` to use a Zap logger as an `io.Writer`.
* [#897][]: Add `zap.WithClock` option to control the source of time via the
  new `zapcore.Clock` interface.
* [#949][]: Avoid panicking in `zap.SugaredLogger` when arguments of `*w`
  methods don't match expectations.
* [#943][]: Add support for filtering by level or arbitrary matcher function to
  `zaptest/observer`.
* [#691][]: Comply with `io.StringWriter` and `io.ByteWriter` in Zap's
  `buffer.Buffer`.
