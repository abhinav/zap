## 1.22.0 (8 Aug 2022)

Enhancements:
* [#1071][]: Add `zap.Objects` and `zap.ObjectValues` field constructors to log
  arrays of objects. With these two constructors, you don't need to implement
  `zapcore.ArrayMarshaler` for use with `zap.Array` if those objects implement
  `zapcore.ObjectMarshaler`.
* [#1079][]: Add `SugaredLogger.WithOptions` to build a copy of an existing
  `SugaredLogger` with the provided options applied.
* [#1080][]: Add `*ln` variants to `SugaredLogger` for each log level.
  These functions provide a string joining behavior similar to `fmt.Println`.
* [#1088][]: Add `zap.WithFatalHook` option to control the behavior of the
  logger for `Fatal`-level log entries. This defaults to exiting the program.
* [#1108][]: Add a `zap.Must` function that you can use with `NewProduction` or
  `NewDevelopment` to panic if the system was unable to build the logger.
* [#1118][]: Add a `Logger.Log` method that allows specifying the log level for
  a statement dynamically.
