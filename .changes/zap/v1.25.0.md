## 1.25.0 (1 Aug 2023)

This release contains several improvements including performance, API additions,
and two new experimental packages whose APIs are unstable and may change in the
future.

Enhancements:
* [#1246][]: Add `zap/exp/zapslog` package for integration with slog.
* [#1273][]: Add `Name` to `Logger` which returns the Logger's name if one is set.
* [#1281][]: Add `zap/exp/expfield` package which contains helper methods
`Str` and `Strs` for constructing String-like zap.Fields.
* [#1310][]: Reduce stack size on `Any`.
