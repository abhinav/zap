## 1.3.0 (25 Apr 2017)

This release adds an enhancement to zap's testing helpers as well as the
ability to marshal an AtomicLevel. It is fully backward-compatible.

Enhancements:

* [#415][]: Add a substring-filtering helper to zap's observer. This is
  particularly useful when testing the `SugaredLogger`.
* [#416][]: Make `AtomicLevel` implement `encoding.TextMarshaler`.
