## 1.4.0 (12 May 2017)

This release adds a few small features and is fully backward-compatible.

Enhancements:

* [#424][]: Add a `LineEnding` field to `EncoderConfig`, allowing users to
  override the Unix-style default.
* [#425][]: Preserve time zones when logging times.
* [#431][]: Make `zap.AtomicLevel` implement `fmt.Stringer`, which makes a
  variety of operations a bit simpler.
